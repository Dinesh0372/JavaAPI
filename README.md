- Docker (for containerization)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd java-microservices-project/service-a
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   Use Maven to build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   You can run the application using the following command:

## Docker Deployment
To deploy Service A using Docker, ensure you have Docker installed and run the following command from the root of the project:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start Service A along with any other services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
